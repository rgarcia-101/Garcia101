            <h4>Who I Am</h4>

            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p>My name is Ruben, and I'm currently a second year at Madison Area Technical College. 
                    I study under the web software developer program, and it has been a thrill to finally be taking the steps towards becoming a true developer.</p>
                <p>Born and raised in the Chicagoland area, I recently moved to Madison WI for family related reasons. I come from a family of immigrants who have found great
                    success here in the US, and I hope to continue that tradition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through Madison College, I have learned the fundamentals of various technogies, including JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS. My current strongest language is Java, which I have been learning since high school
                    and continue to learn in college. I also have some slight background in Python and Swift IOS
                    
                </p>

                <p>Language can be hard, and I'm sure everyone can agree that sometimes words just aren't what we want to use to express ourselves.
                    Over the years I've tried a variety of interests to express who I am; Music, art, skateboarding, and most importantly, technology.
                    Even when I was just a child, computers fascinated me. When I learned about programming, it seemed like the perfect way to turn my interest into a way to express creativity and exercise critical thinking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal as a developer is to work with others who share the same interest in technology to create practical, complex, and impressive software and webapps.
                    I am always looking to expand my knowledge and learn new technologies.
                </p>
