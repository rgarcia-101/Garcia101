            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
            <img src="images/gallery/vert/1.JPG" alt="My bodyshot">
            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p>My name is Ruben, and I am a recent graduate from Madison Area Technical College.
                    I studied under the web software developer program, and it has been a thrill to finally be taking
                    the steps towards becoming a true developer.</p>
                <p>Born and raised in the Chicagoland area, I recently moved to Madison WI for family related reasons. I
                    come from a family of immigrants who have found great
                    success here in the US, and I hope to continue that notion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through Madison College, I have learned the fundamentals of various technogies, including Java,
                    JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS. My current strongest language is Java, which I have been
                    learning since high school
                    and continue to learn through college. I also have some slight background in Python and Swift IOS

                </p>

                <p>Language can be hard, and I'm sure everyone can agree that sometimes words just aren't what we want
                    to use to express ourselves.
                    Over the years I've tried a variety of interests to express who I am; Music, art, skateboarding, and
                    most importantly, technology.
                    Even when I was just a child, computers fascinated me. When I learned about programming, it seemed
                    like the perfect way to turn my interest into a way to express creativity and exercise critical
                    thinking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal as a developer is to work with others who share the same interest in technology to create
                    practical, complex, and well-designed software and webapps. I take pride in my work, and no feeling
                    can compare to how it feels to create something from the ground up.
                    I am always looking to expand my knowledge, learn new technologies, and experience new things.
                </p>
